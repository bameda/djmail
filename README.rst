djmail is a BSD Licensed, simple and nonobstructive django email middleware.

Why use djmail? Because it:

- Sends emails asynchronously without additional libraries.
- Sends emails using celery tasks.
- Can retry sending failed messages (with cron task or celery periodic task).
- Can assign delivery priority.
- Has a powerful class to build emails from templates.
- Works transparently (works as middleware for native django email backends)

djmail was created by Andrey Antukh (@niwinz) and is maintained by David Barrag√°n (@bameda).
